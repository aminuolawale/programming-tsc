A type simply means a set of values and what you can do with them.
More formally it is the set of values and operations that can be performed on them.
For example Number is the set of all numbers and the operations (-, +, *, etc) that can
be performed on them.

noImplicitAny: if this flag is set to true, Typescript will not permit inferred `any` types.
Setting strict to true also enables this.

unknown: setting a variable as unknown means ts wil not try to infer its type. To be allowed
to perform any operation on that variable,you would have to prove to ts that it is of the type
that supports such operation
